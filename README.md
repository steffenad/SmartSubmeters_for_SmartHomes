  A regional home developer wants to develop analytics for a new set of electrical 
  sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes. Installing these submeters
  could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient 
  Smart Homes that providing owners with power usage analytics.
 
  Task: To analyze this data to determine what kind of analytics and visualizations can
  be created that would empower "Smart Home" owners with greater understanding and control 
  of their power usage.


### Data Set:

Abstract: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. The Data Set contains 2075259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

Size Data Set: 2075259

Number of Attributes: 9


Attribute Information:

1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
